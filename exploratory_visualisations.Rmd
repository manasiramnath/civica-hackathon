The cell below creates a bar chart for the mean value of negative mentions of immigration using the data just before and just after the immigration crisis. It shows an increase in the negative mentions of immigration in Denmark and Sweden, but not in Norway. Denmark has the most negative mentions of immigration, but Sweden has the biggest magnitude of change across the time period.

For the most recent data in each country (as long as it is after 2015, plotting the relationship between political spectrum and negative mentions of immigration). Adding a line of best fit shows a positive correlation (as political parties were further to the right, they also tended to have more negative mentions of immigration).
```{r}

civica_eu <- dplyr::filter(civica, eumember == 10)

max_date_rows <- civica_eu %>%
  group_by(countryname) %>%
  filter(date == max(date))

#per601_2 - advocating restriction of immigration
#per608 - against multiculturalism

# Drop rows if date is less than 201512
max_date_rows <- max_date_rows %>% filter(date >= 201512)

# Make a scatter plot where the x axis is 'rile' and the y axis is per601_2, coulored by country, with a line of best fit
